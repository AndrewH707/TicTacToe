# TicTacToe
I'm working on a reinforcement learning approach to TicTacToe. I've developed an environment and have constructed the code so that an action can be chosen and subsequently change the environment. Upcoming updates will focus on state-action pair values and potential algorithms for an agent to be able to play against itself and learn.
